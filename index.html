            <!-- Short Bio -->
            <p class="basic_info">
                I earned my bachelors degree in information technology from Western Governors University. I am currently
                looking to reposition my career path into computer science. I have previously worked as an accounting clerk
                and as an administrative assistant, in companies from 10 to 600 employees.
            </p>
            <!-- Why I'm taking the LearningFuze course. -->
            <p class="basic_info">
                I am attending LearningFuze in order to gain a more in-depth knowledge of web development languages. I
                covered the basics of web development while working towards my degree, but was never required to implement
                the HTML, CSS or JavaScript languages.
            </p>
            <!-- What type of job I would like to obtain following completion. Why I want the job. -->
            <p class="basic_info">
                After completing the LearningFuze cohort I would like to obtain a position in web development. I am drawn
                to a position in this field because it would allow for me to be able to utilize both my creative and
                logical thinking. I would also be challenged by the ever changing projects and languages coming into the
                programming environment.
